Final version of code that I will be using to collect data for lab report.

NOTE: 

1) Drag the file named 0_all into FORTH. This contains the contents of files: 1_useful_words, 2_initialise_variables ... to 11_make_measurements.

2) Please edit line 70 of 0_all since it contains a directory path specific to my PC.

3) To test the life implementation:
  a) can use x y import_glider to import a glider at (x,y) [ x and y must be above 0 and below 100]
  b) can use life_array_2 @ n @ fill_random_1s to fill the grid randomly
  or any other words that are mentioned in the files in this folder
  
4) Drag the file named 12_run_with_graphics to the console and type go to start Life in a new graphics window

5) Alternatively, drag the file named 13_run_no_graphics and type (NUMBER OF GENS) run_x to run a certain number of generations

6) A csv file will be saved at the path mentioned in step 2
